# git-ignore-local VSCode Extension

This extension is a small helper to make it easier to add/remove entries from your `.git/info/exclude` file.

If you aren't aware of what this file is used for, it's essentially `.gitignore` but applies only for you.

## Features

Not much to see here!

* Add a file to be excluded by right clicking in the context menu and clicking `Add to local .gitignore`
* Remove a file exclusion by right clicking in the context menu and clicking `Remove from local .gitignore`

## Release Notes
